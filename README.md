Portfolio
==============

Custom PHP portfolio package for the Laravel 5 framework - developed by Ixudra.

This package can be used by anyone at any given time, but keep in mind that it is optimized for my personal custom workflow. It may not suit your project perfectly and modifications may be in order.



## Installation

Pull this package in through Composer.

```js

    {
        "require": {
            "ixudra/portfolio": "5.*"

Add the service provider to your app.php file

```php

    providers     => array(

        //...
